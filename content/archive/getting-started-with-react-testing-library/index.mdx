Created by Kent C. Dodds

Uses `react-dom` and `react-testing-utils`

Intended to test how your components are actually used. Avoids testing implementation details so you can write stronger tests.

Works with actual DOM nodes, not instances (like Enzyme)

RTL utilities facilitate querying the DOM in the same way the user would.

Recommended to use with Jest, but can be used with any testing framework.
