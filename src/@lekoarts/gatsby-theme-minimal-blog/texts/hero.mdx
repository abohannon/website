I'm a software engineer living in San Diego, CA currently working at [Housecall Pro](https://www.housecallpro.com/).

These days I spend most of my time working in React and Ruby on Rails. I write about programming topics that interest me, bugs I've encountered, or problems I'm working on that could use some [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

I also freelance in my free time. If you're interested in hiring me, I'd love to hear about your project. You can [email me here](mailto:abo46n2@gmail.com).

Other than programming, I spend most my time surfing, seeing how far I can run, drinking coffee, reading, and hanging out with my 3 dogs.
