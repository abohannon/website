I'm a software engineer living in San Diego, CA and currently the team lead of Growth Engineering at Housecall Pro.

These days I spend most of my time working with Javascript, Node, React, Gatsby and Ruby/Rails while dabbling in Rust and Swift. I write about programming topics that interest me, bugs I've encountered, or problems I'm working on that could use some [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

Other than programming, I spend most my time surfing, running, educating myself on social issues, and hanging out with my 3 dogs.
