I'm a software engineer living in San Diego, CA and currently the team lead of growth engineering at Housecall Pro.

These days I spend most of my time working with Javascript, Node, React, Gatsby, Ruby/Rails while teaching myself Java. I write about programming topics that interest me, bugs I've encountered, or problems I'm working on that could use some [rubber ducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

I also freelance in my free time. If you're interested in hiring me, I'd love to hear about your project. You can [email me here](mailto:abo46n2@gmail.com).

Other than programming, I spend most my time surfing, seeing how far I can run, drinking coffee, reading, and hanging out with my 3 dogs.
